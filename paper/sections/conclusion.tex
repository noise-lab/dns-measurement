\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we investigated the DNS response of times of a set of global DoH resolvers from different vantage points.
We find that although most lesser-known resolvers have higher response times than well-known resolvers, a select group of lesser-known resolvers had close response times, or even lower response times, to well-known resolvers. 
Additionally, we find a wide distribution of response times between resolvers despite their close proximity to one another.  

Our findings indicate that...
