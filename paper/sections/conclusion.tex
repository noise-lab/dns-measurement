\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we investigated the DNS response of times of a set of global DoH resolvers from different vantage points.
We find that although most lesser-known resolvers have higher response times than well-known resolvers, a select group of lesser-known resolvers had close response times, or even lower response times, to well-known resolvers. 
Additionally, we find a wide distribution of response times between resolvers despite their close proximity to one another.  
Many of the non-mainstream resolvers are restricted based off of their location.  

Future work could measure page load times alongside DNS response times. 
This would provide greater insight into how user experience is directly impacted by resolver performance.
Measurements of DoT resolvers could also be collected to compare with DoH resolvers and understand if both are impacted by network distance in the same way.
