We find that a most lesser-known resolvers have higher response times than well-known resolvers, which was expected as the operating systems of the well-known resolvers are more robust.
Interestingly, we discovered that a select group of lesser-known resolvers had close response times, or even lower response times, to well-known resolvers.
