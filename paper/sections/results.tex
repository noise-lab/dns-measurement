\subsection{North American Resolvers}
We measured the DNS response times of 17 resolvers located in North America. 
These resolvers failed to respond: dns1.dnscrypt.ca, dns2.dnscrypt.ca, doh.cleanbrowsing.org, doh.post-factum.tk.
Dns9.quad9.net, ordns.he.net, and dns.google had the lowest median response times.
Their respective times were 45.813531499999996, 47.6879475, and 49.821963 ms. 
Dns.nextdns.io, doh.xfinity.com, and doh.la.ahadns.net had the highest median response times. 
Their respective times were 145.78306350000003, 151.908379, 243.775754 ms.
