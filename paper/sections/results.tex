We find that most lesser-known resolvers have higher response times than well-known resolvers, which was expected.
Interestingly, we discovered that a select group of lesser-known resolvers had close response times, or even lower response times, to well-known resolvers. 

Good non-mainstream resolvers: 
	- ordns
	- adguard 
	- opendns
	- mullvad
	- alidns
	- opendns
