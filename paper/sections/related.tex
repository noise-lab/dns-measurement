	- Fig 6 compares resolvers
	- Does not compare at the scale that we do (by region as well)
	- Only measure 26 DoH recursors
	- Largely focus on K-resolver question if the queries should be distributed across multiple resolvers
	- Don't compare mainstream vs. non-mainstream
	- They don't measure a wide array of resolvers. They only study the main ones
