    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fig 6 compares resolvers
	    \item Does not compare at the scale that we do (by region as well)
	    \item Only measure 26 DoH recursors
	    \item Largely focus on K-resolver question if the queries should be distributed across multiple resolvers
	    \item Don't compare mainstream vs. non-mainstream
	    \item They don't measure a wide array of resolvers. They only study the main ones
