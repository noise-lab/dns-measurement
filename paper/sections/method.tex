\section{Method}\label{sec:method}

In this section, we describe the metrics used and these metrics are measured with our experiment setup.

\subsection{Metrics}
To understand how non-mainstream resolvers function in relation to mainstream resolvers, we measure DNS query response times and ping times. 
DNS query response times were gathered using a custom tool, and ping times were gathered with MaxMind's GeoLite2 databases.

- Explain DNS query response times
- Explain ping times (latency)

\subsection{Limitations}
	- Measurements performed on a Debian operating system 
	- We don't measue page load times
