In this section, we describe the metrics used, how these metrics are measured, and our experiment setup.


\subsection{Metrics}
To understand how non-mainstream DoH resolvers function compared to mainstream resolvers, we measure DNS query response times and latency to these resolvers from multiple global vantage points.

\subsubsection{DNS Query Response Time}
DNS query response time is defined as the end-to-end time it takes for a DNS resolver to perform a DNS lookup and return the response (IP address of the domain) to the originating computer.
We modify an existing custom tool bult to measure response times of Do53, DoT, and DoH queries in order to collect accurate DNS query response time measurements for all DoH resolvers[5].
The tool was modified to allow continuous measurements.
With lists of specified recursors and domains, the tool prints performance data to a JSON file including information on the response time from each resolver to a domain and ping latencies to resolvers.
We chose three popular domains for our experiment: Google.com, a search engine, Netflix.com, a streaming service, and Facebook.com, a social media platform. 

\subsubsection{Latency}
Latency is defined as the end-to-end time it takes to receive an ICMP ping response from a DNS resolver.
To confirm our DNS response time measurements, we collected data on latency for each resolver. 
Lower latencies were expected for resolvers with low response times. 

\subsection{Experiment Setup}
To provide a comparative assessment of DNS performance across DoH resolvers, we perform measurements across all available DoH resolvers, grouped by their geographical locationsâ€”North America, Australia, Asia and Europe.
We employed MaxMind's GeoLite2 databases to geolocate each DoH resolver.
That data was used to group the resolvers by location to make them more comparable. 
Table 1 lists the 75 DoH resolvers that we benchmarked and their performance.
