\section{Method}\label{sec:method}

In this section, we describe the metrics used, how these metrics are measured, and our experiment setup.

\subsection{Metrics}
To understand how non-mainstream resolvers function in relation to mainstream resolvers, we measure DNS query response times and latency to these resolvers. 
DNS query response times were gathered using a custom tool, and latency measurements were gathered with MaxMind's GeoLite2 databases.

- Explain DNS query response times
- Explain ping times (latency)

\subsection{Experiment Setup}
- Vantage points + description of hardware
- Network characteristics
- Description of tool
- Length of measurement
- Domains Used

\subsection{Limitations}
	- Measurements performed on a Debian operating system 
	- We don't measue page load times 
	- If vantage points are limited to Chicago
