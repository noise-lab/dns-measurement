\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Major browsers including Brave, Opera, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, only list Cloudflare, Cloudflare for Families, NextDNS, Google, Quad9, OpenDNS, and CleanBrowsing under their encrypted DNS provider options.
Although a limited number of mainstream resolvers exist, we found a total of 75 DoH public servers according to a list published by DNSCrypt.
In this paper, we begin to explore the usability of the DNS encrypted ecosystem as a whole rather than just major operators. 

With this in mind, we studied the following questions:

\begin{itemize}

\item How extensive is the deployment of encrypted DNS outside of the mainstream resolvers?
\item How does the performance of these servers depend on where you are on the network?

\end{itemize}
